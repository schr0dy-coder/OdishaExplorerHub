## üöÄ Setup and Installation

This is a static web project. To run it locally, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. However, for the weather feature to work correctly (due to browser security policies regarding API calls from local files), it's recommended to use a live server.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OdishaExplorerHub.git
    cd OdishaExplorerHub
    ```

2.  **Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
    *   Sign up for a free account on OpenWeatherMap.
    *   You will receive an API key.

3.  **Add the API Key to the code:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file.
    *   Find the `updateWeather` function in the `<script>` section.
    *   Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

4.  **Run with a Live Server:**
    *   If you have VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   Alternatively, you can use any simple local server. If you have Python installed:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üîó How to Link to a GitHub Repository

If you have this project locally and want to push it to a new GitHub repository, follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to GitHub and log in.
    *   Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
    *   Give your repository a name (e.g., `OdishaExplorerHub`).
    *   **Important:** Do *not* initialize the new repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license` file.
    *   Click **"Create repository"**.

2.  **Push Your Existing Code from the Command Line:**
    *   Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal.
    *   Initialize a Git repository:
        ```bash
        git init -b main
        ```
    *   Add all the files to be tracked:
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
    *   Commit your files:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Initial commit: Add Odisha Explorer Hub project files"
        ```
    *   Link your local repository to the remote one you created on GitHub. **Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`** with your details from the GitHub page.
        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
        ```
    *   Push your code to GitHub:
